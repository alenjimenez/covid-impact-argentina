# covid-impact-argentina

The objective of the project is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on a set of health and economic measures in Argentina. For that, I make a comparison between 2020 indicators and their 2019 counterparts using individual survey data from the Permanent Household Survey (Encuesta Permanente de Hogares, EPH, in spanish) published by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses.

Dependent variables (Targets):

- The percentage of population with private health coverage.
- The percentage of population that is occupied.
- Number of hours worked per week.
- Hourly salary.
- The percentage of total income explained by income from the main occupation.
- The percentage of population getting public help through social programs or unemployment insurance.

Independent variables (Features):

- Sex
- Age
- Geographical region
- Economic sector

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Methodology:

The methodology is simple: I implement hypothesis testing to evaluate if differences between periods and groups defined by independent variables are statistically significant.

Software:

R-4.0.3 through RStudio.
